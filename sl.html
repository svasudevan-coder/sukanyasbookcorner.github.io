            A wordy treatise on the aftermath of adultery on the couple who committed the sin/crime in the theocracy that was Massachusetts in the mid-1600s, The Scarlet Letter is interesting and I'm glad I read it, but I didn't care for it overmuch. One reason for that is the vagueness of Hawthorne's theme. Are we to believe in witches, for he includes one in the story, who doesn't hide her allegiance to the devil. Are Hester and her lover and especially little Pearl supposed to be the living embodiment of evil? It seems that Pearl is, because he describes her thus, time and time again. If that is the case, I am glad that thoughts have changed on that issue, at least. I suppose the Puritans didn't believe in forgiveness or redemption or weakness. Their will was to enforce divine law and they did their duty. What a dour book, so bleak! At least, it ends on a bit of an uplift.
