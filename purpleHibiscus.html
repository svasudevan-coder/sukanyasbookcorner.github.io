            Toward the end of Purple Hibiscus, it occurred to me that the character of Papa could be a metaphor for Nigeria and Kambili, the sheltered, naïve young daughter of a wealthy businessman, the Nigerian people. Papa, gifted with an intelligence that holds so much potential, instead wields his power with the cruel, unsparing hand of a megalomaniacal dictator. He crushes, but does not defeat, the spirit of his hopeful, innocent daughter.
            <br></br>
            Adichie is such a master of character ambiguity. It is easy to hate Papa for his fanatic religiosity and his sociopathic control of his family, but here is a Big Man whose wealth supports his community— he provides fuel and food to families one step shy of poverty; he pays school fees so children can rise above and become leaders. Just like Nigeria, that breaks the heart over and over with corruption and civil war, Papa is a force that cannot be stemmed without consequence. You wonder if the heart itself is corrupt, and what could have been done to channel that energy for good instead of ruin.
            <br></br>
            Purple Hibiscus is fragile, just like the flower of its title, just like its narrator, Kambili. It is told with gentle beauty, in striking contrast to the pervading dread and tension that underlies the narrative. There is domestic tension for fifteen-year-old Kambili and her older brother Jaja, who fear coming in second at school, for second simply will not do at home. Their days are regimented, following a strict schedule of study and worship established by their father. Mama is all too often in the middle, taking the brunt of Papa's cruelty, literally with her body, figuratively with her spirit. There is the political tension, as coups ripple through Nigeria, shaking an already-crumbling foundation. Power and fortunes can change hands overnight, and you sense that Papa's brutal hand at home is a reflection of the political reality, as well as a way to maintain control in one area of his life because it could so easily be taken away everywhere else.
            <br></br>
            Kambili's salvation is found in the home of her paternal aunt, the irrepressible Auntie Ifeoma, and her cousins. Beyond the antiseptic confines of her father's estate, Kambili discovers a world of affection and chatter, independence, noise—a ripe and vibrant Nigeria—a place where she belongs that is free of fear and violence, a hopeful could-be, just beyond her terrible what-is.
            <br></br>
            I wasn't quite certain what to make of Father Amadi's character. His affection for the impressionable Kambili made me extremely uncomfortable; I felt he took sickening advantage of a vulnerable young girl, yet Adichie paints him, and their interactions, in a glowing, soft-focus light that is generous beyond a school-girl crush. Again, her skill at creating ambiguous relationships and multi-faceted character shines through, but I squirmed at Kambili's obvious need for the priest's approval and the blurred line he crosses in offering his support.
            <br></br>
            In her singular gorgeous, confident voice, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie delivers a sincere coming-of-age story of a young girl living in under constant threat of domestic and political violence. It is at once deeply personal and universal. It is wholly unforgettable. And you will be left wondering, what is forgivable?
