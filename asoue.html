        <h2><b>3 Stars</b></h2>
        <br></br>

            I am always perplexed on how smart and unique Lemony Snicket writes his stories. This book is such a great children's book, that even non-children can read (including me lol). Not only does it teach you important lessons, but also terms, phrases, and defenitions, and intertwines them into the story making it fun to learn, that is why I wish I would have read this when I was younger. Not only are you being educated but also following a story of these 3 intellectual and bonded sibling orphans that is bittersweet yet soooo enjoyable. I am sad my journey with this series is almost over as there is now only one book left in this series for me to read.
