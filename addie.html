        <p>
            This book is so monotonous, repetitive and shallow. It could have been a hundred pages and the story would have been the same.
            <br></br>
            Addie is simply wandering around cities in two different time periods, meeting strangers and having pointless conversations with them. Nothing seems to have changed about her during the span of 300 years. She hasn’t grown up intellectually, she hasn’t matured in any way, she has no hobbies, no interests. Addie spends her life walking. Nothing is even mentioned about the world around her during those 300 years and the historic events she should have lived through like for example WWII.
            <br></br>
            I thought that when she finally finds the mysterious person who would remember her the story would pick up but that didn’t happen. We got yet another character that walks aimlessly around, moping and feeling bad for himself.
And just as I thought that nothing could possibly make this book any worse came the ending …
